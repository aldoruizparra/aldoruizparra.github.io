# Title: A Song, For YOU

![](AI-Music.png)

## Project Description

When we listen to music on Spotify day-to-day, thereâ€™s an algorithm focused on recommending music, from our top mixes to the song that plays next in our Spotify. Inspired by the music recommendations on Spotify, my project will focus on using neural networks to generate a song FOR YOU! The plan is to expose the neural networks to various genres, from Hip-Hop to Classic Music, to best fit your genre.

The neural network will first be trained to differentiate and detect different types of music. The plan is to smart small, by using the datasets to see if the neural network is able to generate a nice, smooth instrumental based on the genre. If this works as expected, the next step would be to collect music with vocals and lyrics, to test if the Neural Network is able to generate music with words.

Along this project, we will also consider the ethical questions: who should be able to use this technology? And how has AI previously influenced other forms of art? We will look into the history of Artificial Intelligence in art and ask ourselves these questions as we make progress in our project.

## Project Goals

1. Collect a dataset with instrumentals and music from different genres 
2. Teach a a neural network to detect different genres of music
3. Train a NN that is able to to generate instrumentals automatically for you
4. If possible,  extend the previous so that that the NN is able to generate music with lyrics in it.
