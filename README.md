# Title: Neural Networks & Music Generation

![](images/maze-example.png)

## Project Description

Inspired by the rise of AI in art and the music recommendations on Spotify, my project will focus on using neural networks to generate music. The plan is to expose neural networks (NN) to various genres, from Hip-Hop to EDM, from different datasets. Previous projects to do this have already been made, but my goal is to develop a more efficient algorithm to generate music

The trained NN will be "deployed" as an application by putting the NN in new, unseen environments and testing its performance. If all goes well, then an extension of this work will include changing the simulation textures and lighting and training the NN to work when facing unseen textures.

The longer-term goal is to use a NN to enable better navigation in complex environments for a robot with multiple modes of locomotion (i.e., wheeled and flight). The results from this work will feed into an on-going project where we are trying to "cross the reality gap" that exists between simulation and the real world.

## Project Goals

1. Create a dataset for training a NN for navigation.
2. Explore methods for adding "noise" to the dataset.
3. Train a NN that is able to navigate any procedurally generated maze.
