# Title: Neural Networks & Music Generation

![](AI-Music.png)

## Project Description

When we listen to music on Spotify day-to-day, thereâ€™s an algorithm focused on recommending music, from our top mixes to the song that plays next in our Spotify. Inspired by the music recommendations on Spotify, my project will focus on using neural networks to generate a song FOR YOU! The plan is to expose the neural networks to various genres, from Hip-Hop to EDM, to best fit your genre.

As earlier said, the Neural Network will be trained to differentiate different types of music. The plan is to smart small, by using datasets of only instrumentals, to see if the neural networks is able to generate a nice, smooth instrumental that fits well among the genre. The next step would be to see if we are able to collect music with vocals and lyrics, to see if the Neural Network is able to generate music with words.

Along this project, we will also consider the ethical questions: who should be able to use this technology? And how has AI previously influenced other forms of art?

## Project Goals

1. Create a dataset for training a NN for navigation.
2. Explore methods for adding "noise" to the dataset.
3. Train a NN that is able to navigate any procedurally generated maze.
